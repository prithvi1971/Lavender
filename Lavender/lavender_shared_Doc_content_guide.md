# Lavender Content Guide: Blog and Email Content

This guide synthesizes the provided instructions for blog writing by Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners and various email journeys. It outlines the core principles for creating content that aligns with Lavender's voice, style, and strategic goals.

## 1. Overall Content Philosophy & Tone for Lavender

Lavender's content aims to be a trusted, empathetic voice in mental healthcare. The overarching goal is to connect with individuals seeking mental health support, reduce stigma through education, and reflect Lavender's commitment to kind, effective, and timely care.

### Core Tone and Voice:

*   **Warm, Informal, and Friendly:** Content should feel like a conversation with a trusted friend who listens without judgment. The tone is gentle, caring, and approachable—never clinical or cold. Language should be light, human, and easy to follow, fostering a sense of safety and understanding.
*   **Welcoming and Encouraging:** Content should meet people where they are, regardless of their stage in a mental health journey. The tone is hopeful, supportive, and uplifting, but never pushy or dismissive. It recognizes that healing and growth take time and reassures readers that they are not alone and there is hope for a better tomorrow.
*   **Casual and Conversational:** A human-first approach is key. Content should sound like a genuine, open, and honest conversation. It's acceptable to use contractions or sentence fragments for informality. Avoid medical jargon, emphasizing negative comments/effects, or talking down to people. Instead, use everyday language that is clear, kind, uplifting, and comforting.

## 2. Blog Content Guidelines for Psychiatric Nurse Practitioners

### Purpose for Psych NPs:

*   Share personal stories and professional knowledge.
*   Connect with people seeking mental health support.
*   Reduce stigma through education.

### Compensation Information:

*   During your ramp-up period, you will **not** receive extra compensation for content writing.
*   You **might** be eligible for an honorarium payment after your ramp-up period.
*   **Direct all questions or clarification regarding payment to Ada Javier before you begin writing.**

### DO's for Blog Content:

*   **Headers and Subheaders:** Use 2-3 headers and subheaders within your content where possible to improve readability. (0 is also acceptable).
*   **Bullet Points or Numbered Lists:** Incorporate these to break up content and facilitate skim-reading. While not mandatory, they are a significant plus.
*   **Length:** Aim for blog posts that translate to 2-4 minutes of reading time (approximately 600-700 words). Content can extend up to 800 words if necessary.
*   **Hyperlinks:** Elevate your blog posts by adding relevant hyperlinks. These can link to:
    *   Other external websites or news articles.
    *   Citations from books or print publications (non-Internet citations also welcome).
    *   National organizations (e.g., ANCC, American Psychiatric Association).
    *   **Crucially:** If using specific information from an external (non-Lavender) page, link directly to that specific page.
*   **Questions/Q&A-Style:** Integrate a few questions with short, concise answers. Phrase questions as clients might ask them (e.g., "How do I know if I’m making progress in therapy?"). This style should not dominate the majority of the post.
*   **Personal Stories:** Feel free to share personal stories related to mental health, pregnancy, etc., that resonate with the blog's purpose and tone.
*   **Tool Usage:** Use Google Docs for all outlines and blog content to allow the marketing team to annotate directly.

### DON'Ts for Blog Content:

*   **Don't Be Clinical or Cold:** Avoid language that is detached or overly academic.
*   **Don't Be Pushy or Dismissive:** Maintain a welcoming and encouraging stance; avoid demanding or belittling language.
*   **Don't Use Medical Jargon Without Explanation:** If a medical term is used, simplify or briefly explain it for a general audience.
*   **Don't Emphasize Negative Comments/Effects:** Focus on positive framing, solutions, and hope.
*   **Don't Talk Down to People:** Maintain a respectful, peer-to-peer conversational tone.
